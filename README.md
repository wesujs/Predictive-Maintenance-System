# Predictive Maintenance System

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an end-to-end predictive maintenance system that makes use of machine learning models to forecast equipment failures before they happen. The system will process sensor data from industrial equipment, indentify patterns and anomalies, and provide maintenance recommendations through an intuitive online dashboard.

This project comes from the urge to increase my knowledge in machine learning, data science, and software engineering as a whole. It also seems like it could be a good investment for people starting businesses to have once the features, data implemented, and accuracy are all fine-tuned.

## Completed Components âœ…

### Sensor Data Simulator
A Python-based tool that generates realistic industrial sensor data with configurable parameters:
- Multiple sensor types (temperature, vibration, pressure, power consumption)
- Normal operational patterns with appropriate noise and variance
- Seasonal and cyclical variations
- Configurable anomaly patterns (gradual degradation, sudden failures, intermittent issues)
- Time-stamped output in multiple formats (CSV, JSON)
- Streaming API for integration with processing pipeline
- Visualization tools for data inspection and validation

### Anomaly Injection and Testing Framework
Inclusion of complex anomaly injection capabilities
- **Spike Anomalies**: Sudden, short-duration deviations representing power surges or momentary failures
- **Drift Anomalies**: Gradual changes over time that simulate sensor calibration issues or equipment degradation
- **Intermittent Anomalies**: Random, sporadic fluctuations that represent loose connections or interference

### Anomaly Detection Evaluation System
A testing framework to measure the performance of different anomaly detection algorithms
- Precision, recall, and F1 score calculation
- Visualization of detected vs. actual anomalies
- Comparative analysis of detection methods

### Generated Anomalies from Sensor Data Simulator
1. Simple Threshold Detector

This detector will establish static upper and lower boundaries based on the mean and standard   deviation of the entire dataset. It will flag values that exceed these set boundaries as anomalies.

2. Moving Average Detector

This detector compares the data point to a local moving average to identify points that deviate significantly from recent trends. This approach will be more adaptive when changing baseline conditions.

- Z-Score Detector

This detector uses a robust statistical approach based on median values instead of mean. This reduces the influence of extreme values and can be better suited for detecting more subtle anomalies in noisy data.
